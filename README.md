React Hooks Todo App

A minimal, accessible, and fully‑typed Todo application built with React 18 Hooks, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. Add, toggle, filter, and persist tasks – all in fewer than 200 lines of component code.

✨ Key Features

Hook‑centric architecture – built entirely with React hooks (useState, useReducer, useEffect).

LocalStorage persistence – tasks stay after a refresh or browser restart.

Keyboard & screen‑reader friendly – logical tab order, ARIA labels, focus outlines.

Dark / Light theme – adapts automatically to prefers‑color‑scheme.

TypeScript strict mode – type‑safe from component props to reducer actions.

Zero backend – deploy as static files to Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, etc.

<200 lines of UI code – easy to read, extend, and learn from.
